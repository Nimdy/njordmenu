Linux Gaming Servers made easy through the power of education (and... tears from trial and error)

I am starting this projects to help others who want to setup their own Linux gaming servers but do not know where or how to get started.

I will provide simple scripts that will setup, configure and install a envoirnment for a Linux compatible dedicated server game. Over time I believe the community will start submitting their own scripts for others to use, add, remove and comment on. 

The overall object is to teach others through the power of gaming. I cannot think of a better way to learn programming, networking, cloud services and all ther other random things thrown at you when setting up your own dedicated gaming server.


Objectives I hope you will learn over time:

--Programming 
---Bash Shell scripting
---Python
---Others

--Cloud Services and Networking
---Setup (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, Docker, VM)
---Ports and Protocols
---IP Assignment
---Firewall configurations
---SSH connections

--Linux 
---Commands
---File System
---Packages
---Processes
---Logging

--Basic System Adminstration 
---Server Maintenance
---Dealing with ghosts in the machine
---Backup and recovery



--Coming Soon
