Linux Gaming Servers made easy through the power of education (and... tears from trial and error)

I am starting this projects to help others who want to setup their own Linux gaming servers but do not know where or how to get started. 

I will provide simple scripts that you can build on, enabling you to setup, configure and install a envoirnment for your own Linux compatible dedicated gaming server. 

Over time I believe the community will start submitting their own scripts for others to use, add, remove and comment on. Do not be afraid to submit your scripts, heck my coding sucks and people correct me all the time. This helps you grow!  There is always a better way to code something. Its all about the journey, have fun with it! 

The overall object is to teach others through the power of gaming. I cannot think of a better way to learn programming, networking, cloud services and all ther other random things thrown at you when setting up your own dedicated gaming server.


Objectives I hope you will learn over time:

```
--Programming 
---Bash Shell scripting
---Python
---Others

--Cloud Services and Networking
---Setup (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, Docker, VM)
---Ports and Protocols
---IP Assignment
---Firewall configurations
---SSH connections

--Linux 
---Commands
---File System
---Packages
---Processes
---Logging

--Basic System Adminstration 
---Server Maintenance
---Dealing with ghosts in the machine
---Backup and recovery
```

Happy Gaming!
